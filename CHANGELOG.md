# CHANGELOG.md
v0.3.2
- Changed various thresholds and SLO values:
  SLO standardized to target 99 with warning 99.9
  Availability now based on ratio of good responses / total responses at .99
v0.3.1
- Removed: `var.groups` since it is unused.

v0.3.0
- Removed: thresholds map and hardcoded values. Makes module simpler to use by removing moving parts.
- Removed: `var.monitor_ids` since there shouldn't be a need to supply this value separately (it's generated by terraform)
- Fix: updated thresholds to all line up on p95 SLO.

v0.2.2
- more README fixes

v0.2.1
- Fix README

v0.2.0
- New feature: now supports classic ELBs
  Added new required variable: `loadbalancer_type` (application or classic) in order to support both since their metric names are different.

v0.1.0
- Start of Changelog
